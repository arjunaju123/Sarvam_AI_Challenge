        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective is to extract high-quality, meaningful (semantic) segments from the specified YouTube video: [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sby1uJ_NFIY).\n",
        "\n",
        "Suggested workflow:\n",
        "1. **Download Video and Extract Audio:** Download the video and separate the audio component.\n",
        "2. **Transcription of Audio:** Utilize an open-source Speech-to-Text model to transcribe the audio. *Provide an explanation of the chosen model and any techniques used to enhance the quality of the transcription.*\n",
        "3. **Time-Align Transcript with Audio:** *Describe the methodology and steps for aligning the transcript with the audio.*\n",
        "4. **Semantic Chunking of Data:** Slice the data into audio-text pairs, using both semantic information from the text and voice activity information from the audio, with each audio-chunk being less than 15s in length. *Explain the logic used for semantic chunking and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your approach.*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Judgement Criteria:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Precision-Oriented Evaluation:** The evaluation focuses on precision rather than recall. Higher scores are achieved by reporting fewer but more accurate segments rather than a larger number of segments with inaccuracies. Segment accuracy is determined by:\n",
        "   - **Transcription Quality:** Accuracy of the text transcription for each audio chunk.\n",
        "   - **Segment Quality:** Semantic richness of the text segments.\n",
        "   - **Timestamp Accuracy:** Precision of the start and end times for each segment. Avoid audio cuts at the start or end of a segment.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Detailed Explanations:** Provide reasoning behind each step in the process.\n",
        "3. **Generalization:** Discuss the general applicability of your approach, potential failure modes on different types of videos, and adaptation strategies for other languages.\n",
        "4. **[Bonus-1]** **Gradio-app Interface:** Wrap your code in a gradio-app which takes in youtube link as input and displays the output in a text-box.\n",
        "5. **[Bonus-2]** **Utilizing Ground-Truth Transcripts:** Propose a method to improve the quality of your transcript using a ground-truth transcript provided as a single text string. Explain your hypothesis for this approach. *Note that code-snippet isn't required for this question.*\n",
        "\n",
        "  As an example - for the audio extracted from [yt-link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysLiABvVos8), how can we leverage transcript scraped from [here](https://www.newsonair.gov.in/bulletins-detail/english-morning-news-7/), to improve the overall transcription quality of segments?\n",

        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of this task is to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the audio and text data of the 260 chapters of the New Testament in your mother tongue (excluding English). The data should be obtained through web scraping from [Faith Comes By Hearing](https://www.faithcomesbyhearing.com/).\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow for this task should include:\n",
        "1. **Web Scraping:** Systematically download the audio files and their corresponding textual content for each of the 260 chapters of the New Testament from the specified website.\n",
        "2. **Data Preparation:** Organize the data by chapters, ensuring each audio file is matched with its corresponding text.\n",
        "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyze the data to uncover patterns, anomalies, or insights that could benefit applications such as Text to Speech (TTS) and Speech to Text (STT) technologies. Your analysis should explore various facets of the data, including audio quality, text clarity, and alignment between text and spoken content.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Judgement Criteria:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your submission will be evaluated based on:\n",
        "- **Efficiency and Reliability of Web Scraping Techniques:** The methods and tools used for downloading the chapters efficiently and reliably.\n",
        "- **Data Analysis Methods:** The techniques and approaches used for analyzing the audio and text data.\n",
        "- **Quality of Data Analysis:** How effectively the analysis addresses potential applications for the Speech team, including TTS and STT technologies.\n",
        "- **Creativity in Analysis:** Innovative approaches in data handling and analysis, and the use of relevant metrics to assess data quality and applicability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your submission should include the following components:\n",
        "- **Report on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** A concise report detailing the key findings from your analysis, focusing on aspects that are critical for improving TTS and STT applications.\n",
        "- **Methodological Explanation:** A thorough explanation of the methods used for both web scraping and the exploratory data analysis. This should include challenges faced and how they were overcome.\n",
        "- **Supporting Materials:** Include code snippets and visualizations that highlight significant insights from the data. These should be well-documented and easy to understand, demonstrating the logic behind your analytical decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The report should be structured to clearly present the methodology, findings, and implications of your analysis. It should be technical yet accessible, aimed at stakeholders who may have varying levels of familiarity with data analysis techniques.\n",
